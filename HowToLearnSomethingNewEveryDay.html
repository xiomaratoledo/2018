				<h3>Method one of three: </h3>
				<h2>Seeking Out New Information</h2>
				<h4 class="textcolor1">1.Follow the news to keep up with current events.</h4>
				<p>You can learn something everyday by paying attention to the news. you can watch news
				on TV or listen to radio. you can also read traditional newspapers or follow online news sites</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Try to follow both local and international news everyday.For example, read an article in your local paper
					and then check out the BBC.</li>
					<li>Get your information from variety of sources. many news outlets skew left or right, so getting more than one perspective is a great way to learn balanced information</li>

				<h4 class="textcolor1">2.Read books and articles to expand your awareness</h4>
				<p>Reading is one of the most effective ways to learn. Make a point to read everyday. it can be for an hour before
				bed, or just for 10minutes on your lunch break. both fiction and non-fiction are great choices</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Choose a fiction to discover new places through a character's experience. you can also gain insight on emotions
					and interpersonal relationships. For instance, you might try rading The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini To learn about life in afghanistan</li>
					<li>Non-fiction can teach you about anything, from history to how to build a car. if you'd like to learn more about American political history, try Truman by David McCullough.a</li>
					<li>Try listening to an audio book while you cook dinner on your commute.</li>

					<li>Keep in mind that just because something is on the internet doesn't make it true. You still need to verify the source before accepting something as fact. if something doesn't ring true, look for another source to check the information. Try to avoid sites that seem focused on presenting a certain agenda, rather than just the facts.</li>
					<li>Sources such as government agencies, universities, and hospitals typically offer the most factual, up to date information.</li>
