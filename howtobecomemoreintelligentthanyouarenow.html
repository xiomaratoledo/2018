				<h3>Part One of Four:</h3>
				<h2>Improving your mind's abilities</h2>
				<h4 class="text-color1">1. Improve your memory.</h4>
				<p>Much of what is considered intelligence is simply the ability to remember things well. observing something or paying attention is not enough. the key is to retain that information. Associate things you want to memorize with things you already rememeber remember. Associating new information, observing of data with old memories. your technique of connecting and associating memories would be unique. Practice, practice and soon you will be developing new techniques to learn and retain new information faster. only the first attempt is hardest.</p>

				<h3>Part One of Four:</h3>
				
				<h4 class="text-color1">2. Be more curious</h4>
				<p>How do some people get to know so much? Good memory skills are only part of the answer: you also have to be curious.
				if you're satistfied going through life with little or no understanding of things you're unfamilliar with, you won't learn 
				 much. make a concious effort to be more curious by reminding yourself that developing your curiousity will broaden your horizons and help to make you more intelligence</p>
