				<h1>How to Enjoy Christmas Day Spent All by Yourself</h1>
				<p>Christmas time is often associated with family and getting together with loved ones. However, for a variety of reasons, you may sometimes find yourself spending Christmas alone. If this is the case, don't despair. There are plenty of ways to entertain yourself and enjoy the day. From celebrating your favorite traditions alone to going out and exploring the town, you'll find a holiday alone surprisingly enjoyable..</p>

				<h3>Part One of Three: </h3>
				<h2>Participating in Traditions Alone</h2>
				<h4 class="textcolor1">1.Decorate for Christmas.</h4>
				<p> While it may seem unusual to decorate when by yourself, it is a great way to get into the Christmas spirit and lift your mood. Put up your tree, hang decorations around the house, and string up a garland or two. You can also try stringing up some lights out front for visitors to see.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you had a special decorating tradition growing up, you can do that on your own. For example, maybe you always put a Santa hat on top of a Christmas tree instead of a star or angel. Engaging in this tradition alone can help you feel close to your loved ones, even if you can't be there with them personally.</li>

				<h4 class="textcolor1">2.Buy a present for yourself.</h4>
				<p>2.Buy a present for yourself. Is there something you've wanted for a while that you've been hesitant to treat yourself to? If so, splurge a little in the spirit of the season. Indulge yourself in an expensive item you would not normally buy. Buy it a few days before Christmas, but wait until Christmas Day to open it.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>As you'll be saving on travel plans, you can afford a little something extra for yourself. It's okay to buy yourself something a little expensive to celebrate the season.</li>

				<h4 class="textcolor1">3.Get in the festive spirit with Christmas carols.</h4>
				<p> 3.Get in the festive spirit with Christmas carols. You can make a Christmas playlist on a website like YouTube, Spotify, or Pandora. You can also buy some Christmas CDs and play them on your laptop or stereo. Even if you're alone, playing some great Christmas carols can get you in the spirits.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you're not a fan of Christmas carols, think of other songs that you associate with the holiday. For example, play songs that remind you of family members you're not seeing this year. Think back to remember if you were very into a particular album one Christmas season, and play that again to bring back some fond memories.</li>

				<h4 class="textcolor1">4.Enjoy your favorite holiday treats on your own.</h4>
				<p> You don't have to skip on your favorite holidays meals and treats just because you're spending the day alone. A few days before Christmas, go shopping and get yourself ingredients to make some of your holiday favorites</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you're worried about getting too much just for yourself, look for smaller servings. For example, you can get a few slices of precooked ham from a local deli.</li>
					<li>If you're making an entire batch of cookies, enjoy some of them yourself. Send the rest to loved ones in the days following the holidays.</li>

				<h4 class="textcolor1">5.Reminisce about past holidays.</h4>
				<p>  Go through old photos or any mementos you have from past Christmases. Even if you can't be with your family or friends, you can enjoy the memories you had from past Christmases together.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>While reminiscing, try calling your loved ones to say "Hi" and share your Christmas memories together.</li>
					<li>Some people may feel sad reminiscing, especially if you're already sad about being alone for the holidays</li>
					<li>If you find memories are just making you upset or homesick, try to do something else to take your mind off of it.</li>

				<h4 class="textcolor1">6.Send Christmas cards or Christmas emails.</h4>
				<p>  This can be a great way to feel in touch with people, even if you can't be there yourself. Pick up some Christmas cards a few days before Christmas and spend the season writing cards to loved ones. If you don't have any cards, you can write letters and decorate them with things like glitter and bows yourself. You can also simply send a few e-mails wishing those you love a merry Christmas.</p>

				<h3>Part Two of Three: </h3>
				<h2>Enjoying Yourself at Home</h2>
				<h4 class="textcolor1">1.Decorate for Christmas.</h4>
				<p> 1.Spend the day in your pajamas. Part of the reason many people love Christmas is that it's an excuse to do nothing all day. There is no need to wake up and get dressed in the morning for work or school. Indulge yourself in some extra relaxation by throwing on a comfortable pair of pajamas and keeping them on for the day.</p>

				<p>  If you have craft supplies on hand, try entertaining yourself by doing some holiday crafts by yourself. You can make presents for loved ones or small decorations for your own home. Crafts can be very relaxing and also keep you occupied while you're home alone..</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you need inspiration, try looking up craft tutorials on sites like YouTube or browsing Pinterest for craft ideas..</li>

				<h2>Participating in Traditions Alone</h2>
				<h4 class="textcolor1">3.Catch up on reading..</h4>
				<p> Most people have Christmas Day off. If you have a good book you've neglected, pull it out to read on Christmas. Enjoy the day lounging in your pajamas engrossed in a good book.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you're not currently reading anything, you can try reading some short stories. You can sometimes get into short stories faster than you can get into a novel.</li>

				<p>  If you have some holiday favorites, rent them online, watch them on a movie screening service, or dig out your DVDs. You can spend the day marathoning holiday favorites like It's A Wonderful Life and A Christmas Story. You can also browse sites like Hulu and Netflix to see if any Christmas specials from your favorite TV shows are online.</p>

				<p> Do something indulgent for the day that you wouldn't normally take time to do. Take a bubble bath, give yourself an at-home manicure, or drink a glass of wine. As everyone else is being a little indulgent for the day, don't feel guilty treating yourself alone..</p>

				<h3>Part Three of Three: </h3>
				<h2>Going Out</h2>
				<h4 class="textcolor1">1.Decorate for Christmas.</h4>
				<p> 1.Go for a long walk. Taking a long walk around your town can be fun on Christmas Day. A lot of houses will be decorated for the season and there will likely be less crowds or traffic. If you live in an area that snows during the winter season, there may be a beautiful snowfall to observe.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>See if there is a nearby nature trail. Spending a day in the great outdoors can be a great way to enjoy time alone.</li>

				<h4 class="textcolor1">2.Volunteer for the day. </h4>
				<p>Volunteering can be especially helpful if you're feeling a little down about spending the day alone. If you go out and do something for others, it may lift your spirits. See if any local charities or churches are seeking volunteers for Christmas Day and spend the day in service of others.</p>

				<p> Not all restaurants are closed for Christmas. Restaurants that serve food from cultures that don't traditionally celebrate Christmas may be opened. If you find a restaurant that hasn't closed its doors for the day, treat yourself to a meal alone. Bring a book and kick back and enjoy a peaceful dinner or lunch.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you're insecure about eating alone, you can always order take out.</li>

				<p> If you are religious, see what local churches are holding services. Attend a local service on Christmas morning or in the afternoon. This can help remind you why the day is meaningful and give you some scripture to reflect on. You will also be able to interact with fellow churchgoers, which can lift your mood if you're feeling down.</p>

Visit a nearby city to take in the Christmas decorations there. A road trip can be exciting, if you're taking one alone.</p>
